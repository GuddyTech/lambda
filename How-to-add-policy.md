ANSWER:
To add a policy statement that allows the SNS:Publish action on the specified SNS resource (arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:509344471761:lamda), you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.

2. In the IAM console, click on "Roles" or "Users" depending on whether the user is an IAM role or an IAM user.

3. Search for the role or user mentioned in the error message: sendAlertToStudents-role-k9y3ix5m or sendAlertToStudents.

4. Click on the role or user to open its details.

5. In the "Permissions" tab, locate the existing policy attached to the role or user. It might be an inline policy or an attached managed policy.

6. Click on "Add inline policy" or "Attach policies" to add a new policy, depending on your scenario.

7. In the policy editor, you can use the following example policy to grant the necessary permissions:


json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sns:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:509344471761:lamda"
    }
  ]
}


1. Modify the policy document according to your requirements if necessary.

2. Provide a name for the policy and click on "Review policy".

3. Review the policy details and click on "Create policy" or "Attach policy" to save the changes.

Once the policy is added or updated, the user or role specified in the error message will have the necessary permissions to perform the SNS:Publish action on the specified SNS resource.
